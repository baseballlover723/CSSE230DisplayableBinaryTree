## How to use
Have your editor tree class `extend AbstractDisplayableBinaryTree` and have your node class `extend AbstractDisplayableNode`.

Then implement the auto generated methods according to the documentation.

You should be able to call `.show()` on your editor tree which should create a JFrame that displays your editor tree. You can call `.close()` to close the window.

## Found a bug?
[Create an issue on my github repo](https://github.com/baseballlover723/CSSE230DisplayableBinaryTree/issues) and send me an email at baseballlover723@gmail.com with your zipped project and how to reproduce the bug (please include the show command on the relevant test case, I'm less likely to fix a bug if I have to go searching to reproduce it). There is no guarantee that I will fix any bugs in timely manner, but I will try.
